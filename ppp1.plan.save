Requirements:
  use: srandom and random to generate the pseudo random numbers.
//"seed" the random number generator.
// 3 doors labeled 0, 1, and 2

loop 1000 times:
   use random to pick which door has the prize.
     prizeDoor = 
   use random to pick the Player's first choice.
     choice = 
   Monty Hall picks the show door, 
          showDoor =    NOT prizeDoor, and
                        NOT choice
     And shows the goat to the Player.
     And askes: Keep your choice? Or switch?

     If the player is going to switch he/she           NOT choice
        wants a door different from choice and         NOT showDoor
        different from the showDoor.
     So variable altChoice is assigned to be this door

    Player either goes with choice or with altChoice
    we track both strategies:
    if choice==prizeDoor
      stick++
    if altChoice==prizeDoor
      change++
end loop

print stick, change
