General Plan
  get keyword from user
  get length of keyword
  convert keyword to internal representation
  
  get name of the clear file from the user
  open clear file for input; result a filePtr for input
  open cipher file for output; result a filePtr for output


  internal representation: 
    upper case:
      The letters A, B, C, ..., Z will 
      represented by 0, 1, 2, ..., 25
    lower case:
      The letters a, b, c, ..., z will 
      represented by 0, 1, 2, ..., 25

  output: each line: 5 groups of letters in groups of 5.


C library functions:

  fgets(buffer, sizeOfBuffer, stdin)

  //expects two plug-in strings
  //  a file name
  //  and a mode
  //returns a pointer to a FILE object
  FILE *filePtr = fopen(fileName, "mode")
                    where "mode" is "r"  for input
                    and "mode" is "w" for output
  
  //expects a plug-in filePtr to an input file
  //returns the character code of the next character in the file
  fgetc(filePtr)  

  //expects 2 plug-ins,
  //an integer character code
  //and a filePtr to an output file
  //outputs the character code to the file
  fputc(c, filePtr)
